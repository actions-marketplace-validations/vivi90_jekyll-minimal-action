This action provides just Jekyll and some basic build tools ([Alpine's `build-base`](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/v3.3/main/x86/build-base)).
It's based on the [jekyll/minimal:latest](https://github.com/envygeeks/jekyll-docker) [Docker](https://docker.com) image and the [jerryjvl/jekyll-build-action](https://github.com/jerryjvl/jekyll-build-action).

## Usage
```yaml
jobs:
  jekyll:
    name: Build and store Jekyll site
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout üì•
        uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.4
        with:

 - `jekyll build --trace`
 - `jekyll serve`
 - and so on..
